#
# Setup:
# - gauging bore holes with small diameter
# - open at the top, no source/sink (pumping) applied
# - connected to sz layers (leakage coefficient specified)
#
# Desired Results:
# - Exchange flow between each SZ layer and the bore hole
# - Resulting head in the bore hole
#
# Calculating flow: For simplicity we'll use
#   Q = (h_bh - h_i) * A_i * l_i
#     h_bh: head in the bore hole
#     h_i: head in layer i
#     A_i: bore hole exchange area in layer i
#     l_i: leakage in layer i
#   It is a simplification because this equation is for parallel flow lines (straight isobars), while around a well the flow paths are radial (circular isobars).
#   A common equation for wells was formulated by Dupuit-Thiem (actually 2 equations, 1 for free and one for confined aquifers, this is the one for free):
#     Q = Pi * k_f * (h_2^2 - h_1^2)/ln(r_2/r_1)
#       k_f: hydr. conductivity
#       r_1, r_2: distance locations 1 and 2 from bore hole
#       r_1, r_2: distance locations 1 and 2 from bore hole
#   In order to use this equation we'd need 2 points outside the well with known head and distance to the well. Potentially we could use neighbouring grid cells,
#     or there may be other formulations allowing to use just a single head, or maybe it does not even make a huge difference - this could be investigated
#     in the future.
#
# Reasoning: The flow in the bore hole is very fast compared to the SZ flow. If the pressure distribution in the SZ changes,
#            the head in the bore hole will almost instantaneously reach a new equilibrium so that the sum of all exchange
#            flows will be 0.
#
# Two different approaches are implemented to find the head:
#   1.: A closed equation with some limitations regarding accuracy, but quick to program and to execute
#   2.: An iterative solution - more correct, but less efficient
# Both methods can be used, change the source code below: Activate the desired method call in method update_flux_head. Note: The iterative
#   method calls the closed solution for a starting point.
#
# The closed solution:
# The sum of all exchange flows bore hole-layer should be 0:
# 0 = SUM_0n[(h_bh - h_i) * A_i * l_i]
#   SUM_0n: Sum for all i in [0..n]
#
# Resolve to h_bh:
# 0 = SUM_0n[h_bh * A_i * l_i - h_i * A_i * l_i]
# 0 = SUM_0n[h_bh * A_i * l_i] - SUM_0n[h_i * A_i * l_i]
# 0 = h_bh * SUM_0n[A_i * l_i] - SUM_0n[h_i * A_i * l_i]
# SUM_0n[h_i * A_i * l_i] = h_bh * SUM_0n[A_i * l_i]
#________________________________________________________
#          SUM_0n[h_i * A_i * l_i]
#   h_bh = -----------------------
#            SUM_0n[A_i * l_i]
#________________________________________________________
#
# The iterative solution:
# In each iteration the sum of all exchange flows bore hole-layer is calculated - the target for this is 0. The head for the next iteration will
# be calculated using the secant method. When abs value of the sum of flows is below the threshold (see constant EPS) the solution will be accepted.

#
# Leakage coefficient, conductivity and flow distance
#
# The leakage coefficient can be interpreted as an abstraction of the hydr. conductivity k_f and the flow distance (let's call it df).
# leakge = k_f / df.
# It is not trivial to chose df.
#
#   For simplicity let's assume this: The head in a cell is an average of the sub-cell distribution. If water is going into or out of the bore hole
# a cone will form around the cell center=bore hole location. The average cell head will represent the actual value everywhere on a circle around
# the center where the circle covers half the area of the cell. Such a circle has a radius of about 0.4 times the cell size, so let's use this for
# the flow distance (see variable FLOW_DISTANCE_CELL_RATIO).
#

#
# Current Limitations and Omissions
#
#### General:
# Timing:
#   Due to the explicit coupling of the bore hole to the SZ (the bore hole exchange and the SZ solver are executed one after the other) the exchange flows are
#   based on the heads of the _previous_ SZ time step. If a better temporal resolution is required, the time step length should be reduced.
#
# Custom result folder:
#   Not currently supported - not provided by MShePy, result folder needed for reading SZ layer bottoms.
#
# Memory:
#   Currently all data for the bore hole dfs0 file is collected over the entire simulation to be written at the very end.
#   This may or may not become a problem with many bore holes, short SZ time steps and long simulations.
#
#### Limitations closed solution:
# Exchange area:
#   The exchange area is static, assuming that flow is through the entire depth of each layer.
#   This is of course not always the case, especially for the top layer. The exchange area should be updated dynamically
#   where the layer is not fully submerged, e. g. using the average head of bore hole and layer (limited to within the layer thickness).
#
# Driving head:
#   The driving head will be calculated using the bore hole head even if it is below the bottom of the layer.
#   However in this situation instead the elevation of the bottom of the layer should be used.
#
# Open length of bore hole:
#   Each bore hole will extend from the bottom to the top of the model. A limited depth and a potential coating in the top layer(s)
#   are not taken into account.
